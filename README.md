# Node-RED IBM Cloud Demo for the Assembly Workshop - Make a Driverless Car Part 1
##Node-RED in IBM Cloud
Node-RED is an open source visual flow-based programming tool used for wiring not only Internet of Things (IoT) components, but also integrating an ensemble of services APIs including ones provided by IBM Cloud. <br/>
This repository provides an example of a Node-RED application that is supposed to grab car probe data from a RaspberryPI device that is positioned inside an RC car and visualize both the data and the driver behavior analysis. This data is collected from sensors including IR, Ultra-sonic and accelerometer (MPU-6050) modules. A GPS module is not used to allow the usage of the system in-doors.<br/>
The application explored in this repository can be deployed into IBM Cloud through following the simple steps explained below. <br/>
